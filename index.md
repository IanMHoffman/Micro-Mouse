# Micromouse Project Introduction

This is a personal project of mine to design, build, and program a new micromouse that will be internationally competitive. I have designed a few for fun using off the shelf components and development boards. This one will be designed on custom PCBs to make better use of space and weight.

## What Is A Micromouse?

Many people have not heard of a micromouse. It is a robot designed to solve a maze, like a mouse is often portrayed doing. It is actually the worlds longest running robotic contest introduced by IEEEin 1977. There is are two main micromouse divisions, classic and half size. Regardless of the division each mouse is required to solve the maze completely autonomously.

### Classic Micromouse

Classic micromouse, often just called micromouse, where the robot has to solve a 16x16 grid of cells. each cell is a 180mm square. The walls of the maze are 50mm high.



The other is Half
