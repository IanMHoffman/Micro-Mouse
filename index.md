# Micromouse Project Introduction

This is a personal project of mine to design, build, and program a new micromouse that will be internationally competitive. I have designed a few for fun using off the shelf components and development boards. This one will be designed on custom PCBs to make better use of space and weight.

## What Is A Micromouse?

Many people have not heard of a micromouse. It is a robot designed to solve a maze, like a mouse is often portrayed doing. It is actually the worlds longest running robotic contest introduced by IEEEin 1977. There is are two main micromouse divisions, classic and half size. Regardless of the division each mouse is required to solve the maze completely autonomously. As the mouse navigates the maze it locates and records the locations of the walls. This allows the mouse to solve the maze and pick the shortest, or fastest path to the objective.

### Classic Micromouse

Classic micromouse, often just called micromouse, where the robot has to solve a 16x16 grid of cells. each cell is a 180mm square. The walls of the maze are 50mm high. The mouse starts in a corner and has to make it to the central objective, a 2x2 area centered in the maze. The mice themselves must be able to fit into a 25cm square. There is no height limitation for the robot.

### Half Size Micromouse

Half size micromouse is the newest form of the competition. It was introduced for the 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition in 2009. Unlike classic micromouse this form has a 32x32 grid of cells. The cell dimensions have also been reduced by half to a 90mm square. The size of a half mouse is limited to a 12.5cm square while still having no height restriction.
